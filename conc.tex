\section{Conclusion}
We explored the use of different powerful features that are present in modern GPU architectures and applied them to D-IrGL. We faced interesting challenges in implementing them and also got ideas for several interesting directions for future work. We hope that the contributions of the project will prove to be valuable additions in the Gluon communication substrate and will improve the performance of distributed graph analytics frameworks significantly.
